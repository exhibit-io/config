## Usage

### Running the Application

You can run the application using the Go command:

```sh
go run cmd/your-app/main.go
```

### Configuration Management

The `config` package provides a flexible and modular way to manage configurations for your microservice. The package uses the `Configurable` interface, which allows you to define and validate configurations for different services.

### Default Configurations

The default configurations provided in the `config` package include:

- **RedisConfig**: Configuration for Redis.
- **CorsConfig**: Configuration for CORS.

### Adding External Configurations

You can extend the configuration by implementing the `Configurable` interface in your custom configuration structs. For example, the `TrackerConfig` in `pkg/config/tracker.go` demonstrates how to add an external configuration.

To add your configuration, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Go file in the `pkg/config/` directory.
2. Implement the `Configurable` interface.
3. Register your configuration in `main.go`:

    ```go
    cfg.Register(&config.YourCustomConfig{})
    ```

### Testing

Unit tests for the `config` package are provided in `pkg/config/config_test.go`. To run the tests, use:

```sh
go test ./pkg/config
```
